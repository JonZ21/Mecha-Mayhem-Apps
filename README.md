**Robotevents-Selenium-Scraper**

Designed to scrape information from robotevents and provide live updates to a tournament livestream
- Was designed as a prototype to collect live match data from [robotevents](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-22-7814.html#results-)
- Reads skills and match information using pre-set XPATHs
- Decided to switch to an MQTT server becuase selenium updates too slowly
